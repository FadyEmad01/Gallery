          Artist:"Johannes Vermeer",
          description1: "Girl with a Pearl Earring is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 20th century because of the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.",
          description2: "The painting is a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century description of a head that was not meant to be a portrait. It depicts a European girl wearing exotic dress, an oriental turban, and what appears to be a very large pearl as an earring. The subject of the painting is unknown, with it being possible either that she was a real model, or that Vermeer created a more generalised and mysterious woman, perhaps representing a Sibyl or biblical figure. There has been speculation that she is the artist's eldest daughter, Maria, though this has been dismissed as an anachronism by some art historians.",
